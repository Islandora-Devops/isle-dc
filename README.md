## Introduction

[Docker Compose] project facilitating creation and management of Islandora 8
Infrastructure under [Docker] using [Docker Compose].

This is a prototype of the `docker-compose` file, Docker service and image
configuration structure for the ISLE Phase III - ISLE / Islandora 8 Prototype
(isle-dc) project.

The workflow for this repository centers around using the provided
[Makefile](./Makefile) to generate an appropriate `docker-compose.yml` file.

There are **three** `ENVIRONMENT`s or ways of development that this repository
supports:

- **demo** *(Example site for testing the images)*
- **local** *(Local development using composer/drush in the codebase folder)*
- **custom** *(Use a custom built image or generate one from the codebase folder)*

To quickly get started, we recommend running the [demo](#-demo) environment
first after you have completed the [Installation](#-installation).

A walkthrough for setting up a simple local installation is available in the
Islandora documentation: [Install Islandora on Docker (ISLE)](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/installation/docker-compose/)

## Requirements

- Composer 1.10+
- Desktop / laptop / VM (*Docker must have sufficient resources to run GNU Make*)
- Docker-CE 19.x+ (*If using Docker Desktop for Windows, any stable release
  *after* 2.2.0.4, or use a 2.2.0.4 with a [patch][Docker for Windows Patch] due
  to a [bug][Docker for Windows Bug]*)
- Docker-compose version 1.25.x+
- Drush 9.0+
- Git 2.0+
- GNU Make 4.0+
- PHP 7.2+ (*Also requires the same ext packages you intend to use in your site.*)
- Perl (if you want to run `make dev` which does find-and-replace in some files with Perl)

## Installation

### Configuring the Environment

To run the containers you must first generate a `docker-compose.yml` file. It is
the only orchestration mechanism provided to launch all the containers, and have
them work as a whole.

To get started generate the defaults with the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will create the following files which you can **customize**:

| File                     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                   |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.env`                   | Responsible for setting variables used in `docker-compose.*.yml` files </br> Determines which `docker-compose.*.yml` are included in `docker-compose.yml` |
| `docker-compose.env.yml` | Allows the user to set environment settings inside  of containers and override any services configuration                                                 |

At a minimum, you'll want to consider setting `ENVIRONMENT` in the `.env` file to either `demo`, `local`, or `custom`. The default is `demo`.

#### Changing the host name

By default, the domain `traefik.me` is used, which resolves to `localhost`, but allows us to treat things as if there were a fully qualified domain name.  Namely, we can have https in development and staging scenarios, even when all you have is an IP address.

However, if you are deploying somewhere other than `localhost` and you own a domain, you can change it by setting `DRUPAL_SITE_HOST` in the .env file.  That is,
for `example.org`:

```bash
DRUPAL_SITE_HOST=example.org
```

#### Using an IP address

If you have an IP address but no domain, you can set the value to `X-X-X-X.traefik.me`, where X-X-X-X is your IP address, but with hyphens
instead of dots.  For example, if your IP address is `123.45.67.89`:

```bash
DRUPAL_SITE_HOST=123-45-67-89.traefik.me
```

There are also a handful of variables in `docker-compose.env.yml` you'll want to adjust if using an IP address with traefik.me.  For each of these,
change the dot between COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME and DRUPAL_SITE_HOST to a hyphen (i.e. ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-isle-dc}.${DRUPAL_SITE_HOST-traefik.me}
becomes ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-isle-dc}-${DRUPAL_SITE_HOST-traefik.me}).  If you have any doubts about what you're doing, just copy/paste these values
directly into place in your `docker-compose.env.yml` file.

| Variable                      | Value                                                                                                |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DRUPAL_DEFAULT_CANTALOUPE_URL | <https://islandora-${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-isle-dc}-${DRUPAL_SITE_HOST-traefik.me}/cantaloupe/iiif/2> |
| DRUPAL_DEFAULT_DB_HOST        | ${DRUPAL_DATABASE_SERVICE}-${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-isle-dc}-${DRUPAL_SITE_HOST-traefik.me}            |
| DRUPAL_DEFAULT_FCREPO_HOST    | fcrepo-${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-isle-dc}-${DRUPAL_SITE_HOST-traefik.me}                                |
| DRUPAL_DEFAULT_MATOMO_URL     | <https://islandora-${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-isle-dc}-${DRUPAL_SITE_HOST-traefik.me}/matomo/>           |
| DRUPAL_DEFAULT_SITE_URL       | <https://islandora-${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-isle-dc}.${DRUPAL_SITE_HOST-traefik.me}>                   |
| MATOMO_SITE_HOST              | islandora-${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-isle-dc}-${DRUPAL_SITE_HOST-traefik.me}                             |

When using an IP address, your site will be available at https://islandora-isle-dc-X-X-X-X.traefik.me/, where X-X-X-X is your IP address. For example, https://islandora-isle-dc-123-45-67-89.traefik.me/

### Applying changes

Once you are happy with your changes to the above files you can regenerate the
`docker-compose.yml`, and pull the required images using the
[Makefile](./Makefile) like so:

```bash
make
```

After this point you can just interact with the `docker-compose.yml` file like
you would normally.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

With [Docker Compose] there are many features such as displaying logs among
other things for which you can find detailed descriptions in the
[Docker Composer CLI Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/)

## Demo Environment

To quickly get started, we recommend running the [demo](#-demo) environment first.

This is the default environment if you do a clean checkout of this repository and run the following:

```bash
make
docker-compose up -d
```

This environment is just meant as a show case of the basic `islandora` site.

You should be able to reach it in your browser at `islandora-isle-dc.traefik.me`
if you followed the instructions under the [Installation](#-installation)
section.

## Local Environment

This environment is intended for local development. Users will create a `Drupal`
site in the folder [codebase](./codebase), which gets bind mounted into the
`drupal` service container. Allowing developers to use `composer` / `drush`
locally to work out of the [codebase](./codebase) folder.

There are a three ways in which you can create a local environment.

- From the `islandora/demo` image.
- From an existing site.
- From scratch.

**N.B:** Before attempting any of these methods make sure you have set `ENVIRONMENT` to
`local` in your `.env` file.

After you have setup your local site you can then work directly out of the
`codebase` folder, as if you had installed `Drupal` locally.

### Create Local Environment from islandora/demo Image

The following [Makefile](./Makefile) command is provided as method to quickly
get a site up using the `islandora/demo` image as base.

```bash
make create-codebase-from-demo
```

It will take a few minutes to spin up the demo instance, export its
configuration and copy the site into the [codebase](./codebase) folder.

Once this is done you can bring up your local site using `docker-compose`.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

At this point the site will not be installed. There are **two** ways to do an
installation, from an existing configuration or in a stepwise fashion.

**After** either of your chosen methods you will still need to update services
like `solr` and `blazegraph`, etc, these commands are combined into a single
target for convenience.

```bash
make hydrate
```

#### From existing Configuration

To be able to install from an existing configuration you must change the
following environment variables in `docker-compose.env.yml`:

| Environment Variable                   | Value                       |
| :------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| DRUPAL_DEFAULT_CONFIGDIR               | /var/www/drupal/config/sync |
| DRUPAL_DEFAULT_INSTALL_EXISTING_CONFIG | "true"                      |
| DRUPAL_DEFAULT_PROFILE                 | minimal                     |

Regenerate your `docker-compose.yml` file, and restart the container.

```bash
make docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

You also need to change the site configuration to use the minimal profile.

```bash
make remove_standard_profile_references_from_config
```

At this point you should be able to perform the installation

```bash
make install
```

Finally configure the rest of the site which depends on environment variables.

```bash
make hydrate
```

**N.B.:** There is a
[bug](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2914213) which affects
`islandora_fits`. For now you must manually set a value. Visit
<http://islandora-isle-dc.traefik.me/taxonomy/term/1/edit> and set the value
`URL` to <https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits>.

#### Manually

 you can install it by running the
following [Makefile](./Makefile) command:

```bash
make install
```

That will create the required database and install a bare bones site.

Now that the `drupal` service is running you can update the `settings.php` with
the appropriate settings from the environment variables defined in
`docker-compose.env.yml`, by running the following [Makefile](./Makefile)
command:

```bash
make update-settings-php
```

At this point the site is still bare-bones as we have not imported the site
configuration. Or you can manually setup the site as you see fit. To import an
existing configuration you can use the following command.

```bash
make config-import
```

*N.B:* You'll have to run this twice, due to bugs in the dependencies of configurations!

Finally configure the rest of the site which depends on environment variables.

```bash
make hydrate
```

**N.B.:** There is a
[bug](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2914213) which affects
`islandora_fits`. For now you must manually set a value. Visit
<http://islandora-isle-dc.traefik.me/taxonomy/term/1/edit> and set the value
`URL` to <https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits>.

### Create Local Environment from Existing Site

Copy or clone your existing site into the [codebase](./codebase) folder. Start the system with `docker-compose up -d`, then run composer install via `docker-compose exec drupal with-contenv bash -lc 'COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer install'` and make sure your database and user are created with `make databases`, and that your settings.php file is correct with `make update-settings-php`.

Then you have a number of options you can:

- Follow the same installation procedure as the demo [from an existing configuration](#from-existing-configuration)
- Follow the same installation procedure as the demo [manually](#manually)

Or you can import an existing database if you have it.

```bash
make database-import SRC=/tmp/dump.sql
```

Finally configure the rest of the site which depends on environment variables.

```bash
make hydrate
```

### Create Local Environment from Scratch

You can create a composer project for your drupal site from scratch.

Some popular examples:

- drupal/recommended-project
- drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev
- islandora/drupal-project:8.8.1
- born-digital/drupal-project:dev-isle8-dev

```bash
mkdir ./codebase
cd ./codebase
composer create-project --ignore-platform-reqs --no-interaction --no-install drupal/recommended-project .
composer require -- drush/drush
composer install
make
docker-compose up -d
make install
```

At this point you should have a functioning Drupal site that you can customize
as you see fit using `composer` / `drush` commands in the codebase folder.

## Custom Environment

This environment is used to run your custom `drupal` image which can be produced
outside of this repository. You can specify the image in your `.env` file using
the settings `PROJECT_DRUPAL_DOCKERFILE` if you want to build it in the context
of this repository.

For convenience a `sample.Dockerfile` is provided from which you can generate a
custom image from the [codebase](./codebase) folder. For example if you followed
the guide above to create the codebase folder from the `islandora/demo` image.

And then run it by changing `ENVIRONMENT` to be `custom` and regenerating the
`docker-compose.yml` file and building the image.

```bash
make docker-compose.yml
make build
```

At this point you could run it using `docker-compose`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To specify an image created outside of this repository, you can add the
following to `docker-compose.env.yml`:

```yaml
drupal:
  image: YOUR_CUSTOM_IMAGE
```

## Services

Islandora is composed of many different services, this project has split these
services up such that they have their own
[Container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).

For in-depth documentation of the various `islandora` images see the
[isle-buildkit](https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/isle-buildkit) repository.

Other services will be documented below:

### Watchtower

The [watchtower](https://hub.docker.com/r/v2tec/watchtower/) container monitors
the running Docker containers and watches for changes to the images that those
containers were originally started from. If watchtower detects that an image has
changed, it will automatically restart the container using the new image. This
allows for automatic deployment, and overall faster development time.

Note however Watchtower will not restart stopped container or containers that
exited due to error. To ensure a container is always running, unless explicitly
stopped, add ``restart: unless-stopped`` property to the container in the
[docker-compose.yml] file. For example:

```yaml
mariadb:
    image: islandora/mariadb:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
```

The watchtower can be disabled/enabled via the `INCLUDE_WATCHTOWER_SERVICE`
variable in your `.env` file.

```bash
# Includes `watchtower` as a service.
INCLUDE_WATCHTOWER_SERVICE=true
```

### Traefik

The [traefik](https://containo.us/traefik/) container acts as a reverse proxy,
and exposes some containers through port ``80``/``443``/``3306``. This allows access to the
following urls by default.

- <http://activemq-isle-dc.traefik.me/admin>
- <http://blazegraph-isle-dc.traefik.me/bigdata>
- <mysql://database-isle-dc.traefik.me:3306>
- <https://islandora-isle-dc.traefik.me>
- <https://islandora-isle-dc.traefik.me/matomo/>
- <https://islandora-isle-dc.traefik.me/cantaloupe>
- <http://fcrepo-isle-dc.traefik.me/fcrepo/rest>

Since Drupal passes links to itself in the messages it passes to the microservices,
and occasionally other urls need to be resolved on containers that do not have
external access, we define aliases for most services on the internal network.

Aliases like so are defined on most services to mimic their routing rules in
Traefik:

```yaml
drupal:
    image: islandora/demo:latest
    # ...
    networks:
      default:
        aliases:
          - islandora-isle-dc.traefik.me
```

The `traefik` service can be disabled/enabled via the `INCLUDE_TRAEFIK_SERVICE`
variable in your `.env` file.

```bash
# Includes `traefik` as a service.
INCLUDE_TRAEFIK_SERVICE=true
```

### ETCD

The [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd) container is a distributed reliable
key-value store, which this project can use for configuration settings and secrets.

It is not enabled by default.

```bash
# Includes `etcd` as a service.
INCLUDE_ETCD_SERVICE=false
```

## FAQ

### Question: When doing an `drush config:import -y` I get one of the following errors

**Error:**

```html
Site UUID in source storage does not match the target Storage.
```

This occurs when your configuration has come from a site other than the one that
is currently installed. You can run the following command to override the site
`uuid` so that you can import your configuration:

```bash
make set-site-uuid
```

**Error:**

```html
Entities exist of type <em class="placeholder">Shortcut link</em> and <em class="placeholder">Shortcut set</em>
<em class="placeholder">Default</em>. These entities need to be deleted before importing
```

These are entities created by the `standard` installation profile, you can delete
them with the following command in the codebase folder:

```bash
make delete-shortcut-entities
```

**Error:**

```bash
Error: Call to a member function getConfigDependencyName() on null in ... Entity/EntityDisplayBase.php on line 325 #0 ... /codebase/web/core/lib/Drupal/Core/Config/Entity/ConfigEntityBase.php(318): Drupal\Core\Entity\EntityDisplayBase->calculateDependencies()
```

There is some bug in the dependencies of the various modules. Until those
dependencies issues are resolved just rerun the command until they go away.

```bash
drush config:import -y
```

### Question: When doing an `drush sql:dump` I get one of the following errors

**Error:**

This arises from our use of [MariaDB] for the database in Docker, not matching
the same client on your host system. Which probably uses the [MySQL] clients
`mysqldump` executable. You can specify the following command using drush to get
around it:

```bash
drush sql:dump --extra-dump="--column-statistics=0" > /tmp/dump.sql
```

Or you can use the provided method in the [Makefile](./Makefile) which should be
more portable.

```bash
make database-dump DEST=/tmp/dump.sql
```
