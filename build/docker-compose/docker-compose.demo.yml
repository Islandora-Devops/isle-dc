# This is just an example of of creating a Drupal 8 site with Islandora from
# scratch as a series of startup scripts before the nginx server starts.
#
# Its primary use is for testing changes to the containers.
#
# Organizations should not use this as their base instead they should refer
# to the documentation in this project for the correct approach.
